Governing Equations of Motion Projectile motion follows Newton's laws of motion and assumes motion under uniform gravitational acceleration with no air resistance. The fundamental equations arise from Newton\u2019s Second Law: \\[ \\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a} \\] Since the only force acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance) is gravity, we have: \\[ F_y = -mg, \\quad F_x = 0 \\] Thus, the equations of motion can be written as: [ m a_x = 0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a_x = 0 ] [ m a_y = -mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a_y = -g ] Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, we get: \\[ \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0, \\quad \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g \\] 2. Solving the Differential Equations Horizontal Motion Integrating the horizontal acceleration equation: \\[ \\frac{dv_x}{dt} = 0 \\] \\[ v_x = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\] Since velocity is the derivative of position: \\[ \\frac{dx}{dt} = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\] Integrating again: \\[ x(t) = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot t \\] Vertical Motion Integrating the vertical acceleration equation: \\[ \\frac{dv_y}{dt} = -g \\] \\[ v_y = v_0 \\sin \\theta - gt \\] Since velocity is the derivative of position: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dt} = v_0 \\sin \\theta - gt \\] Integrating again: \\[ y(t) = v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] 3. Range of the Projectile The range \\( R \\) is the horizontal distance the projectile travels before hitting the ground (i.e., when \\( y = 0 \\) ). Setting \\( y(t) = 0 \\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin \\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Solving for \\( t \\) , we get: \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Substituting into the equation for \\( x(t) \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos \\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin \\theta}{g} \\] Using the identity \\( 2 \\sin \\theta \\cos \\theta = \\sin 2\\theta \\) , we obtain the range formula: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] 4. Family of Solutions and Dependence on Initial Conditions The range depends on both the initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) and the launch angle \\( \\theta \\) . The maximum range occurs at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) , since \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) is maximized at \\( 90^\\circ \\) . The same range can be achieved with complementary angles \\( \\theta_1 \\) and \\( \\theta_2 = 90^\\circ - \\theta_1 \\) , as \\( \\sin 2\\theta \\) is the same for both. Effect of Gravity Increasing gravity \\( g \\) decreases the range since \\( R \\propto 1/g \\) . Lower gravity environments (e.g., Moon or Mars) allow longer ranges for the same launch velocity. Effect of Initial Velocity The range is quadratic in \\( v_0 \\) , meaning a slight increase in velocity results in a significantly larger range. Conclusion The projectile motion equations provide deep insight into real-world applications, from sports physics to space exploration. The range formula highlights the key dependencies on angle, velocity, and gravity, illustrating the elegance of motion under constant acceleration.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-theoretical-foundation","text":"","title":"Projectile Motion: Theoretical Foundation"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-governing-equations-of-motion","text":"Projectile motion follows Newton's laws of motion and assumes motion under uniform gravitational acceleration with no air resistance.
