Governing Equations of Motion Projectile motion follows Newton's laws of motion and assumes motion under uniform gravitational acceleration with no air resistance. The fundamental equations arise from Newton\u2019s Second Law: \\[\\mathbf{F}=m\\mathbf{a}\\] Since the only force acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance) is gravity, we have: \\[F_y=-mg,\\quad F_x=0\\] Thus, the equations of motion can be written as: \\[m a_x=0 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a_x=0\\quad m a_y=-mg \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad a_y=-g\\] Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, we get: \\[\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=0,\\quad \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-g\\] 2. Solving the Differential Equations Horizontal Motion Integrating the horizontal acceleration equation: \\[\\frac{dv_x}{dt}=0\\] \\[v_x=v_0\\cos\\theta\\] Since velocity is the derivative of position: \\[\\frac{dx}{dt}=v_0\\cos\\theta\\] Integrating again: \\[x(t)=v_0\\cos\\theta\\cdot t\\] Vertical Motion Integrating the vertical acceleration equation: \\[\\frac{dv_y}{dt}=-g\\] \\[v_y=v_0\\sin\\theta-gt\\] Since velocity is the derivative of position: \\[\\frac{dy}{dt}=v_0\\sin\\theta-gt\\] Integrating again: \\[y(t)=v_0\\sin\\theta\\cdot t-\\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\] 3. Range of the Projectile The range \\(R\\) is the horizontal distance the projectile travels before hitting the ground (i.e., when \\(y=0\\) ). Setting \\(y(t)=0\\) : \\[0=v_0\\sin\\theta\\cdot t-\\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\] Solving for \\(t\\) , we get: \\[t=\\frac{2 v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}\\] Substituting into the equation for \\(x(t)\\) : \\[R=v_0\\cos\\theta\\cdot\\frac{2 v_0\\sin\\theta}{g}\\] Using the identity \\(2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta=\\sin 2\\theta\\) , we obtain the range formula: \\[R=\\frac{v_0^2\\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\] 4. Family of Solutions and Dependence on Initial Conditions The range depends on both the initial velocity \\(v_0\\) and the launch angle \\(\\theta\\) . The maximum range occurs at \\(\\theta=45^\\circ\\) , since \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) is maximized at \\(90^\\circ\\) . The same range can be achieved with complementary angles \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2=90^\\circ-\\theta_1\\) , as \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) is the same for both. Effect of Gravity Increasing gravity \\(g\\) decreases the range since \\(R\\propto 1/g\\) . Lower gravity environments (e.g., Moon or Mars) allow longer ranges for the same launch velocity. Effect of Initial Velocity The range is quadratic in \\(v_0\\) , meaning a slight increase in velocity results in a significantly larger range. Conclusion The projectile motion equations provide deep insight into real-world applications, from sports physics to space exploration. The range formula highlights the key dependencies on angle, velocity, and gravity, illustrating the elegance of motion under constant acceleration. Projectile Motion: Theoretical Analysis of Range 1. Relationship Between Horizontal Range and Angle of Projection The horizontal range \\(R\\) of a projectile is defined as the horizontal distance it travels before returning to its initial height. The standard equation for range, derived from kinematic equations, is: \\[R=\\frac{v_0^2\\sin 2\\theta}{g}\\] where: - \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity, - \\(\\theta\\) is the angle of projection, - \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Effect of Angle on Range The function \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) determines how the range varies with the angle of projection. The range is maximized when \\(\\sin 2\\theta=1\\) , which occurs at \\(\\theta=45^\\circ\\) . The same range can be obtained for complementary angles \\(\\theta\\) and \\(90^\\circ-\\theta\\) because \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) has the same value for both. Thus, for any initial velocity, the two angles that yield the same range are given by: \\[\\theta_1+\\theta_2=90^\\circ\\] Graphical Representation The function \\(R(\\theta)\\) follows a symmetric pattern, reaching its maximum at \\(45^\\circ\\) and decreasing symmetrically for angles above and below this value. 2. Dependence of Range on Initial Velocity and Gravity Effect of Initial Velocity From the range equation: \\[R\\propto v_0^2\\] Doubling the initial velocity results in a fourfold increase in range. The relationship between range and velocity is quadratic , meaning small increases in velocity can significantly impact the range. Effect of Gravitational Acceleration From the range equation: \\[R\\propto\\frac{1}{g}\\] An increase in gravitational acceleration reduces the range. On planets with lower gravity (e.g., the Moon, Mars), a projectile launched with the same velocity and angle will travel much farther than on Earth. 3. Practical Applications of Range Analysis Sports Science In ballistics and sports like basketball, soccer, and golf, understanding range helps optimize shooting angles for maximum distance or accuracy. Athletes adjust their throwing or kicking angles based on desired projectile motion. Engineering and Defense Artillery and missile trajectory calculations rely on precise range equations to hit targets efficiently. Engineers design launch systems considering variations in \\(g\\) due to altitude or planetary conditions. Space Exploration Rocket launches consider Earth's gravity and initial velocity to optimize fuel efficiency and trajectory. Space agencies simulate projectile motion under different gravitational conditions for extraterrestrial landings. Conclusion The range of a projectile is influenced significantly by the angle of projection, initial velocity, and gravitational acceleration. The mathematical relationships governing projectile motion allow for precise predictions, leading to various applications in sports, engineering, and space exploration.

Theoretical Foundation of the Forced Damped Pendulum The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by the differential equation \u03b8\u0308 + \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2sin(\u03b8) = Fcos(\u03a9t) , where \u03b8 represents angular displacement (in radians), \u03b3 is the damping coefficient (s\u207b\u00b9), \u03c9\u2080 = \u221a(g/L) is the natural frequency (rad/s) with g as gravitational acceleration and L as pendulum length, F is the amplitude of the driving force (rad/s\u00b2), and \u03a9 is the driving frequency (rad/s). This equation captures three key influences: \u03b8\u0308 is the angular acceleration (second derivative of displacement), \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 is a damping term proportional to angular velocity representing energy loss (e.g., due to air resistance), \u03c9\u2080\u00b2sin(\u03b8) is the nonlinear restoring force due to gravity, and Fcos(\u03a9t) is the external periodic force driving the system. The presence of sin(\u03b8) makes this a nonlinear differential equation, complicating exact solutions. For small-angle oscillations, we approximate sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 (valid for small \u03b8 in radians, e.g., < 0.1 rad), simplifying the equation to a linear form: \u03b8\u0308 + \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2\u03b8 = Fcos(\u03a9t) . This resembles a damped harmonic oscillator with a harmonic forcing term, which is much easier to solve analytically. The steady-state solution to this linearized equation, after transient effects decay, is \u03b8(t) = A cos(\u03a9t - \u03c6) . Here, the amplitude is given by A = F / \u221a((\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03a9\u00b2)\u00b2 + (\u03b3\u03a9)\u00b2) , showing how it depends on the difference between the natural frequency ( \u03c9\u2080 ) and driving frequency ( \u03a9 ), moderated by damping ( \u03b3 ). The phase shift, \u03c6 = tan\u207b\u00b9(\u03b3\u03a9 / (\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03a9\u00b2)) , indicates the lag between the driving force and the pendulum\u2019s response, influenced by damping and frequency mismatch. To analyze resonance conditions, we identify the driving frequency that maximizes amplitude. By taking the derivative of A with respect to \u03a9 and setting it to zero, we find the resonance frequency to be approximately \u03a9_res \u2248 \u221a(\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03b3\u00b2/2) (valid for \u03b3 < \u221a2\u03c9\u2080 , i.e., light damping). At this frequency, the denominator of the amplitude expression is minimized, peaking the amplitude at A_max \u2248 F / (\u03b3\u221a(\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03b3\u00b2/4)) . This shows that amplitude grows significantly when damping ( \u03b3 ) is small, as the denominator shrinks. At resonance, the driving frequency aligns closely with the system\u2019s adjusted natural frequency, leading to efficient energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum. Each push reinforces the pendulum\u2019s motion, maximizing oscillation amplitude. Regarding energy transfer and amplitude growth, resonance occurs when \u03a9 \u2248 \u03a9_res , allowing the driving force to pump energy into the system effectively because the oscillations are in sync. The damping term \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 dissipates energy, limiting amplitude growth; at resonance, energy input balances this dissipation, stabilizing the amplitude at A_max . In the absence of damping ( \u03b3 = 0 ), the linear model predicts unbounded amplitude growth, which is unphysical since nonlinear effects (e.g., the full sin(\u03b8) term) would dominate at large angles. Thus, damping plays a critical role in keeping the system realistic, while resonance highlights the condition of maximum energy efficiency and amplitude. This text integrates the differential equation, small-angle approximation, approximate solutions, resonance analysis, and energy discussion into a single narrative, blending concise notes with detailed explanations. Let me know if you need adjustments or additional details!

Analysis of Dynamics of the Forced Damped Pendulum The dynamics of the forced damped pendulum, described by the equation \u03b8\u0308 + \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2sin(\u03b8) = Fcos(\u03a9t) , are profoundly influenced by the damping coefficient ( \u03b3 ), driving amplitude ( F ), and driving frequency ( \u03a9 ), each playing a distinct role in shaping the system\u2019s behavior. The damping coefficient \u03b3 governs energy dissipation\u2014when \u03b3 is low, oscillations persist with minimal loss, sustaining motion, whereas a high \u03b3 rapidly suppresses swings, driving the pendulum toward rest as friction overtakes the system. The driving amplitude F determines the energy injected into the pendulum; a small F elicits a weak, harmonic response confined to the linear regime where sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 , but a large F pumps enough energy to excite the nonlinear sin(\u03b8) term, pushing the system into complex, unpredictable territory. The driving frequency \u03a9 tunes the pendulum\u2019s reaction\u2014near the natural frequency \u03c9\u2080 = \u221a(g/L) , it triggers resonance with large amplitudes, but far from \u03c9\u2080 , it can lead to subdued or irregular motion due to frequency mismatch. These parameters collectively dictate the pendulum\u2019s evolution, steering it between regular motion (harmonic or periodic) and chaotic motion (marked by sensitivity to initial conditions), with physical interpretations rooted in everyday experience: low \u03b3 and moderate F near resonance produce predictable swings like a gently pushed swing, while high F or specific \u03a9 values amplify nonlinearity, yielding erratic motion akin to a pendulum tossed in a storm. This interplay drives transitions between motion types, starting with regular motion\u2014harmonic or periodic\u2014where the small-angle approximation sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 simplifies the equation, yielding a steady-state solution \u03b8(t) = A cos(\u03a9t - \u03c6) with amplitude A = F / \u221a((\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03a9\u00b2)\u00b2 + (\u03b3\u03a9)\u00b2) , embodying a consistent, predictable response to the driving force. As F grows or \u03a9 shifts, the nonlinearity of sin(\u03b8) disrupts this order, ushering in chaotic motion where tiny changes in initial conditions (e.g., \u03b8(0) or \u03b8\u0307(0) ) spawn vastly different trajectories\u2014a defining trait of chaos, often sparked by high F overwhelming damping or \u03a9 straying from resonance. Physically, regular motion reflects a balanced energy exchange, maintaining steady swings, while chaos signifies an overwhelmed system, flooded with energy and unable to settle, its wild swings defying prediction. To dissect these dynamics, we employ phase space trajectories, Poincar\u00e9 sections, and bifurcation diagrams, each offering a unique lens on the pendulum\u2019s behavior across periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic regimes. Phase space trajectories, plotting \u03b8 versus \u03b8\u0307 , reveal the motion\u2019s character: periodic motion traces closed loops\u2014an ellipse for small angles or a distorted cycle for nonlinear periodicity\u2014quasiperiodic motion weaves torus-like paths from multiple incommensurate frequencies, and chaotic motion fills a bounded region with tangled, unpredictable curves, illustrating a progression from order to complexity. Poincar\u00e9 sections sample this trajectory at each driving period ( t = 2\u03c0n/\u03a9 ), distilling it into points: a single point signals period-1 motion (pure periodicity), a closed curve hints at quasiperiodicity (multiple frequencies without repetition), and scattered points betray chaos, capturing the system\u2019s state in snapshots that highlight its regularity or lack thereof. Bifurcation diagrams plot steady-state \u03b8 (from Poincar\u00e9 cuts) against a parameter like F , mapping the broader evolution\u2014periodic motion appears as fixed points or narrow bands, period-doubling emerges as these split (e.g., 1\u21922\u21924 cycles), and chaotic regions sprawl as broad, irregular spreads, charting how increasing F drives the pendulum from harmony through cascading transitions into unpredictability. Together, these tools illuminate the dynamics: trajectories show the continuous flow, sections pinpoint key moments, and bifurcations reveal the roadmap, tying \u03b3 , F , and \u03a9 to the pendulum\u2019s journey from steady swings to wild, sensitive chaos.

Here\u2019s a single, cohesive text combining the markdown notes and explanations for the practical applications of the forced damped pendulum model, presented as a unified narrative. Practical Applications of the Forced Damped Pendulum The forced damped pendulum model, encapsulated by the equation \u03b8\u0308 + \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2sin(\u03b8) = Fcos(\u03a9t) , extends its theoretical framework into practical real-world scenarios such as energy harvesting devices, suspension bridges, and oscillating electronic circuits, where its parameters\u2014damping coefficient ( \u03b3 ), natural frequency ( \u03c9\u2080 ), and driving force ( Fcos(\u03a9t) )\u2014map onto tangible dynamics with distinct engineering goals. In energy harvesting devices , the model represents a pendulum-like mechanism driven by ambient vibrations (e.g., wind or machinery motion), with \u03b8 as the displacement of a mass or beam, Fcos(\u03a9t) mimicking external forcing, \u03b3 reflecting mechanical damping, and \u03c9\u2080 as the system\u2019s inherent frequency; the objective is to convert this oscillatory motion into electrical energy via electromagnetic or piezoelectric methods, leveraging sustained swings to maximize output by tuning F and \u03a9 to environmental conditions. For suspension bridges , it captures the oscillatory response of the bridge deck to periodic loads like wind or traffic, where \u03b3 embodies damping from materials or stabilizers, \u03c9\u2080 = \u221a(g/L) ties to the structure\u2019s natural frequency (with L as a characteristic length), and Fcos(\u03a9t) represents external forces; the aim here is ensuring structural stability to prevent excessive swaying that could lead to collapse. In oscillating electronic circuits , such as LC (inductor-capacitor) circuits with external driving, the pendulum\u2019s behavior parallels voltage or current oscillations, with \u03b8 as charge or voltage, \u03b3 as resistance, \u03c9\u2080 as the circuit\u2019s resonant frequency, and Fcos(\u03a9t) as an applied signal; the goal is reliable signal generation or amplification for communication or processing systems. These applications adapt the pendulum\u2019s principles\u2014balancing damping, natural frequency, and forcing\u2014to address practical challenges, showcasing its versatility beyond theoretical physics. The influence of resonance and chaos , core features of the pendulum model, profoundly shapes these applications, offering both opportunities and risks. Resonance occurs when the driving frequency \u03a9 aligns with the natural frequency \u03c9\u2080 (adjusted by damping as \u03a9_res \u2248 \u221a(\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03b3\u00b2/2) ), maximizing amplitude via A_max \u2248 F / (\u03b3\u221a(\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03b3\u00b2/4)) for significant effects. In energy harvesting devices, resonance enhances efficiency by amplifying oscillations when \u03a9 matches ambient vibration frequencies, optimizing energy capture, though excessive amplitude risks mechanical wear or failure if damping is insufficient. In suspension bridges, resonance can be catastrophic\u2014when wind or traffic frequencies hit \u03c9\u2080 , as in the Tacoma Narrows collapse, large amplitudes threaten structural integrity, requiring robust \u03b3 to dissipate energy and maintain safety. In oscillating circuits, resonance boosts signal strength when \u03a9 \u2248 \u03c9\u2080 , improving performance in amplifiers or oscillators, but an overly strong response can overload components, necessitating careful design. On the flip side, chaos emerges when high F or specific \u03a9 values amplify the nonlinear sin(\u03b8) term, driving unpredictable, sensitive-to-initial-conditions motion. In energy harvesting, chaos disrupts with erratic swings, reducing consistent output and efficiency as the system fails to settle into a rhythm. In suspension bridges, it manifests as wild, unpredictable swaying under strong, irregular forcing (e.g., turbulent winds), posing a safety hazard as tiny perturbations lead to drastic shifts. In circuits, chaos introduces noise or instability, scrambling signals and undermining reliability, especially if nonlinear elements exacerbate sensitivity. Thus, resonance amplifies desired effects or hazards\u2014maximizing energy, risking collapse, or enhancing signals\u2014while chaos injects unpredictability, challenging efficiency, safety, and stability, making the pendulum model a powerful lens for understanding and managing these real-world systems. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd Pendulum parameters w0 = 1.0 # Natural frequency g = 0.1 # Damping coefficient F = 0.5 # Driving force amplitude O = 0.995 # Driving frequency (near resonance) t_span = (0, 100) # Time span dt = 0.01 # Time step theta0, omega0 = 0.1, 0.0 # Initial conditions Convert to first-order system def derivatives(t, y, g, w0, F, O): theta, omega = y dtheta_dt = omega domega_dt = -g * omega - w0**2 * np.sin(theta) + F * np.cos(O * t) return np.array([dtheta_dt, domega_dt]) RK4 solver def rk4(t_span, dt, y0, g, w0, F, O): t = np.arange(t_span[0], t_span[1] + dt, dt) y = np.zeros((len(t), 2)) y[0] = y0 for i in range(len(t) - 1): k1 = derivatives(t[i], y[i], g, w0, F, O) k2 = derivatives(t[i] + dt/2, y[i] + dt/2 * k1, g, w0, F, O) k3 = derivatives(t[i] + dt/2, y[i] + dt/2 * k2, g, w0, F, O) k4 = derivatives(t[i] + dt, y[i] + dt * k3, g, w0, F, O) y[i + 1] = y[i] + (dt/6) * (k1 + 2 k2 + 2 k3 + k4) return t, y Solve for different conditions def solve_pendulum(g, F, O): y0 = [theta0, omega0] t, y = rk4(t_span, dt, y0, g, w0, F, O) return t, y[:, 0], y[:, 1] # t, theta, omega Time evolution plot t, theta, omega = solve_pendulum(g, F, O) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4)) plt.plot(t, theta, label='\u03b8(t)') plt.plot(t, omega, label='\u03c9(t)') plt.xlabel('Time (s)') plt.ylabel('Amplitude') plt.title('Time Evolution') plt.legend() plt.show() Phase portrait plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.plot(theta, omega) plt.xlabel('\u03b8 (rad)') plt.ylabel('\u03c9 (rad/s)') plt.title('Phase Portrait') plt.show() Poincar\u00e9 section poincare_theta = [theta[i] for i in range(len(t)) if abs(t[i] % (2 np.pi/O)) < dt/2] poincare_omega = [omega[i] for i in range(len(t)) if abs(t[i] % (2 np.pi/O)) < dt/2] plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.scatter(poincare_theta, poincare_omega, s=1) plt.xlabel('\u03b8 (rad)') plt.ylabel('\u03c9 (rad/s)') plt.title('Poincar\u00e9 Section') plt.show() Bifurcation diagram (varying F) F_values = np.linspace(0.1, 1.5, 100) bif_theta = [] for F in F_values: t, theta, omega = solve_pendulum(g, F, O) poincare_theta = [theta[i] for i in range(len(t)) if abs(t[i] % (2*np.pi/O)) < dt/2] bif_theta.extend(poincare_theta[-10:]) # Last 10 points for steady state plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4)) plt.scatter(F_values.repeat(10), bif_theta, s=1) plt.xlabel('F (Driving Amplitude)') plt.ylabel('\u03b8 (rad)') plt.title('Bifurcation Diagram') plt.show() Table of parameter effects conditions = [ {'\u03b3': 0.1, 'F': 0.5, '\u03a9': 0.995, 'Description': 'Regular (Resonance)'}, {'\u03b3': 0.1, 'F': 1.5, '\u03a9': 0.995, 'Description': 'Chaotic'}, {'\u03b3': 1.0, 'F': 0.5, '\u03a9': 0.995, 'Description': 'Damped Regular'}, {'\u03b3': 0.1, 'F': 0.5, '\u03a9': 0.5, 'Description': 'Off-Resonance'} ] data = [] for cond in conditions: t, theta, omega = solve_pendulum(cond['\u03b3'], cond['F'], cond['\u03a9']) max_amplitude = np.max(np.abs(theta[-len(t)//2:])) # Steady-state amplitude data.append([cond['\u03b3'], cond['F'], cond['\u03a9'], max_amplitude, cond['Description']]) df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['\u03b3', 'F', '\u03a9', 'Max Amplitude', 'Description']) print(\"\\nParameter Effects Table:\") print(df) Save table to CSV (optional) df.to_csv('pendulum_parameters.csv', index=False)","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#problem-2","text":"Here\u2019s a single, cohesive text combining the markdown notes and explanations for the theoretical foundation of the forced damped pendulum.","title":"Problem 2"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#theoretical-foundation-of-the-forced-damped-pendulum","text":"The motion of a forced damped pendulum is governed by the differential equation \u03b8\u0308 + \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2sin(\u03b8) = Fcos(\u03a9t) , where \u03b8 represents angular displacement (in radians), \u03b3 is the damping coefficient (s\u207b\u00b9), \u03c9\u2080 = \u221a(g/L) is the natural frequency (rad/s) with g as gravitational acceleration and L as pendulum length, F is the amplitude of the driving force (rad/s\u00b2), and \u03a9 is the driving frequency (rad/s). This equation captures three key influences: \u03b8\u0308 is the angular acceleration (second derivative of displacement), \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 is a damping term proportional to angular velocity representing energy loss (e.g., due to air resistance), \u03c9\u2080\u00b2sin(\u03b8) is the nonlinear restoring force due to gravity, and Fcos(\u03a9t) is the external periodic force driving the system. The presence of sin(\u03b8) makes this a nonlinear differential equation, complicating exact solutions. For small-angle oscillations, we approximate sin(\u03b8) \u2248 \u03b8 (valid for small \u03b8 in radians, e.g., < 0.1 rad), simplifying the equation to a linear form: \u03b8\u0308 + \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 + \u03c9\u2080\u00b2\u03b8 = Fcos(\u03a9t) . This resembles a damped harmonic oscillator with a harmonic forcing term, which is much easier to solve analytically. The steady-state solution to this linearized equation, after transient effects decay, is \u03b8(t) = A cos(\u03a9t - \u03c6) . Here, the amplitude is given by A = F / \u221a((\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03a9\u00b2)\u00b2 + (\u03b3\u03a9)\u00b2) , showing how it depends on the difference between the natural frequency ( \u03c9\u2080 ) and driving frequency ( \u03a9 ), moderated by damping ( \u03b3 ). The phase shift, \u03c6 = tan\u207b\u00b9(\u03b3\u03a9 / (\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03a9\u00b2)) , indicates the lag between the driving force and the pendulum\u2019s response, influenced by damping and frequency mismatch. To analyze resonance conditions, we identify the driving frequency that maximizes amplitude. By taking the derivative of A with respect to \u03a9 and setting it to zero, we find the resonance frequency to be approximately \u03a9_res \u2248 \u221a(\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03b3\u00b2/2) (valid for \u03b3 < \u221a2\u03c9\u2080 , i.e., light damping). At this frequency, the denominator of the amplitude expression is minimized, peaking the amplitude at A_max \u2248 F / (\u03b3\u221a(\u03c9\u2080\u00b2 - \u03b3\u00b2/4)) . This shows that amplitude grows significantly when damping ( \u03b3 ) is small, as the denominator shrinks. At resonance, the driving frequency aligns closely with the system\u2019s adjusted natural frequency, leading to efficient energy transfer from the driving force to the pendulum. Each push reinforces the pendulum\u2019s motion, maximizing oscillation amplitude. Regarding energy transfer and amplitude growth, resonance occurs when \u03a9 \u2248 \u03a9_res , allowing the driving force to pump energy into the system effectively because the oscillations are in sync. The damping term \u03b3\u03b8\u0307 dissipates energy, limiting amplitude growth; at resonance, energy input balances this dissipation, stabilizing the amplitude at A_max . In the absence of damping ( \u03b3 = 0 ), the linear model predicts unbounded amplitude growth, which is unphysical since nonlinear effects (e.g., the full sin(\u03b8) term) would dominate at large angles. Thus, damping plays a critical role in keeping the system realistic, while resonance highlights the condition of maximum energy efficiency and amplitude.

Thus, resonance amplifies desired effects or hazards\u2014maximizing energy, risking collapse, or enhancing signals\u2014while chaos injects unpredictability, challenging efficiency, safety, and stability, making the pendulum model a powerful lens for understanding and managing these real-world systems. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd","title":"Practical Applications of the Forced Damped Pendulum"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#pendulum-parameters","text":"w0 = 1.0 # Natural frequency g = 0.1 # Damping coefficient F = 0.5 # Driving force amplitude O = 0.995 # Driving frequency (near resonance) t_span = (0, 100) # Time span dt = 0.01 # Time step theta0, omega0 = 0.1, 0.0 # Initial conditions","title":"Pendulum parameters"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#convert-to-first-order-system","text":"def derivatives(t, y, g, w0, F, O): theta, omega = y dtheta_dt = omega domega_dt = -g * omega - w0**2 * np.sin(theta) + F * np.cos(O * t) return np.array([dtheta_dt, domega_dt])","title":"Convert to first-order system"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#rk4-solver","text":"def rk4(t_span, dt, y0, g, w0, F, O): t = np.arange(t_span[0], t_span[1] + dt, dt) y = np.zeros((len(t), 2)) y[0] = y0 for i in range(len(t) - 1): k1 = derivatives(t[i], y[i], g, w0, F, O) k2 = derivatives(t[i] + dt/2, y[i] + dt/2 * k1, g, w0, F, O) k3 = derivatives(t[i] + dt/2, y[i] + dt/2 * k2, g, w0, F, O) k4 = derivatives(t[i] + dt, y[i] + dt * k3, g, w0, F, O) y[i + 1] = y[i] + (dt/6) * (k1 + 2 k2 + 2 k3 + k4) return t, y","title":"RK4 solver"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#solve-for-different-conditions","text":"def solve_pendulum(g, F, O): y0 = [theta0, omega0] t, y = rk4(t_span, dt, y0, g, w0, F, O) return t, y[:, 0], y[:, 1] # t, theta, omega","title":"Solve for different conditions"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#time-evolution-plot","text":"t, theta, omega = solve_pendulum(g, F, O) plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4)) plt.plot(t, theta, label='\u03b8(t)') plt.plot(t, omega, label='\u03c9(t)') plt.xlabel('Time (s)') plt.ylabel('Amplitude') plt.title('Time Evolution') plt.legend() plt.show()","title":"Time evolution plot"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#phase-portrait","text":"plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.plot(theta, omega) plt.xlabel('\u03b8 (rad)') plt.ylabel('\u03c9 (rad/s)') plt.title('Phase Portrait') plt.show()","title":"Phase portrait"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#poincare-section","text":"poincare_theta = [theta[i] for i in range(len(t)) if abs(t[i] % (2 np.pi/O)) < dt/2] poincare_omega = [omega[i] for i in range(len(t)) if abs(t[i] % (2 np.pi/O)) < dt/2] plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6)) plt.scatter(poincare_theta, poincare_omega, s=1) plt.xlabel('\u03b8 (rad)') plt.ylabel('\u03c9 (rad/s)') plt.title('Poincar\u00e9 Section') plt.show()","title":"Poincar\u00e9 section"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#bifurcation-diagram-varying-f","text":"F_values = np.linspace(0.1, 1.5, 100) bif_theta = [] for F in F_values: t, theta, omega = solve_pendulum(g, F, O) poincare_theta = [theta[i] for i in range(len(t)) if abs(t[i] % (2*np.pi/O)) < dt/2] bif_theta.extend(poincare_theta[-10:]) # Last 10 points for steady state plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4)) plt.scatter(F_values.repeat(10), bif_theta, s=1) plt.xlabel('F (Driving Amplitude)') plt.ylabel('\u03b8 (rad)') plt.title('Bifurcation Diagram') plt.show()","title":"Bifurcation diagram (varying F)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#table-of-parameter-effects","text":"conditions = [ {'\u03b3': 0.1, 'F': 0.5, '\u03a9': 0.995, 'Description': 'Regular (Resonance)'}, {'\u03b3': 0.1, 'F': 1.5, '\u03a9': 0.995, 'Description': 'Chaotic'}, {'\u03b3': 1.0, 'F': 0.5, '\u03a9': 0.995, 'Description': 'Damped Regular'}, {'\u03b3': 0.1, 'F': 0.5, '\u03a9': 0.5, 'Description': 'Off-Resonance'} ] data = [] for cond in conditions: t, theta, omega = solve_pendulum(cond['\u03b3'], cond['F'], cond['\u03a9']) max_amplitude = np.max(np.abs(theta[-len(t)//2:])) # Steady-state amplitude data.append([cond['\u03b3'], cond['F'], cond['\u03a9'], max_amplitude, cond['Description']]) df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['\u03b3', 'F', '\u03a9', 'Max Amplitude', 'Description']) print(\"\\nParameter Effects Table:\") print(df)","title":"Table of parameter effects"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_2/#save-table-to-csv-optional","text":"df.to_csv('pendulum_parameters.csv', index=False)","title":"Save table to CSV (optional)"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/","text":"Orbital Period and Orbital Radius Motivation The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law , is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems. Task 1. Derivation of the Relationship for Circular Orbits Consider an object of mass \\(m\\) (e.g., a planet or a satellite) orbiting a much larger object of mass \\(M\\) (e.g., a star or a planet) in a circular orbit of radius \\(r\\) with an orbital period \\(T\\) . The gravitational force between the two objects provides the centripetal force required for the circular motion. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation , the gravitational force \\(F_g\\) is given by: \\[F_g = G \\frac{Mm}{r^2}\\] where \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant. The centripetal force \\(F_c\\) required to keep the object of mass \\(m\\) moving in a circle of radius \\(r\\) with a speed \\(v\\) is given by: \\[F_c = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\\] For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force must equal the centripetal force: \\[G \\frac{Mm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv^2}{r}\\] We can cancel the mass of the orbiting object \\(m\\) from both sides: \\[G \\frac{M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r}\\] The speed \\(v\\) of the orbiting object is related to the orbital radius \\(r\\) and the orbital period \\(T\\) by the formula: \\[v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\] Substituting this expression for \\(v\\) into the equation above: \\[G \\frac{M}{r^2} = \\frac{(2\\pi r/T)^2}{r}\\] Simplify the equation: \\[G \\frac{M}{r^2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2 r}$$ $$G \\frac{M}{r^2} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r}{T^2}\\] Now, rearrange the equation to solve for \\(T^2\\) : \\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{GM}\\] This equation shows that the square of the orbital period \\(T^2\\) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius \\(r^3\\) , with the constant of proportionality being \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}\\) . This is Kepler's Third Law for circular orbits. 2. Implications for Astronomy Kepler's Third Law has several crucial implications for astronomy: Determining the Mass of a Central Body: If we know the orbital period \\(T\\) and the orbital radius \\(r\\) of an object orbiting a central body, we can calculate the mass \\(M\\) of the central body using the rearranged formula: \\[M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{GT^2}\\] This is how the masses of stars, planets, and even black holes can be estimated by observing the orbits of their satellites or companion stars. Predicting Orbital Periods and Radii: Conversely, if we know the mass of the central body and either the orbital period or the orbital radius of an orbiting object, we can predict the other quantity. This is essential for planning satellite missions and understanding the dynamics of planetary systems. Understanding Planetary Systems: Kepler's Third Law provides a fundamental framework for understanding the structure and evolution of planetary systems. The consistent relationship between orbital periods and radii across different planets in a system supports the idea of a common formation mechanism. 3. Real-world Examples Let's consider two examples: the Moon orbiting the Earth and the Earth orbiting the Sun. The Moon Orbiting the Earth: Orbital Period of the Moon ( \\(T_{\\text{Moon}}\\) ): \\(\\approx 27.3 \\text{ days} \\approx 27.3 \\times 24 \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds} \\approx 2.36 \\times 10^6 \\text{ s}\\) Average orbital radius of the Moon ( \\(r_{\\text{Moon}}\\) ): \\(\\approx 384,400 \\text{ km} \\approx 3.844 \\times 10^8 \\text{ m}\\) Mass of the Earth ( \\(M_{\\text{Earth}}\\) ): \\(\\approx 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\text{ kg}\\) Gravitational constant ( \\(G\\) ): \\(\\approx 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2\\) Let's verify Kepler's Third Law using these values. Calculate \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3_{\\text{Moon}}}{GM_{\\text{Earth}}}\\) : \\[\\frac{4\\pi^2 (3.844 \\times 10^8)^3}{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11})(5.972 \\times 10^{24})} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times (3.14159)^2 \\times 5.66 \\times 10^{25}}{3.985 \\times 10^{14}} \\approx 5.62 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ s}^2\\] Now, let's calculate \\(T^2_{\\text{Moon}}\\) : \\[(2.36 \\times 10^6)^2 \\approx 5.57 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ s}^2\\] The calculated value from Kepler's Third Law is very close to the square of the Moon's orbital period, confirming the law. The Earth Orbiting the Sun: Orbital Period of the Earth ( \\(T_{\\text{Earth}}\\) ): \\(\\approx 365.25 \\text{ days} \\approx 365.25 \\times 24 \\times 3600 \\text{ seconds} \\approx 3.156 \\times 10^7 \\text{ s}\\) Average orbital radius of the Earth ( \\(r_{\\text{Earth}}\\) ): \\(\\approx 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ m}\\) Mass of the Sun ( \\(M_{\\text{Sun}}\\) ): \\(\\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\text{ kg}\\) Calculate \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3_{\\text{Earth}}}{GM_{\\text{Sun}}}\\) : \\[\\frac{4\\pi^2 (1.496 \\times 10^{11})^3}{(6.674 \\times 10^{-11})(1.989 \\times 10^{30})} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times (3.14159)^2 \\times 3.348 \\times 10^{33}}{1.327 \\times 10^{20}} \\approx 1.00 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ s}^2\\] Now, let's calculate \\(T^2_{\\text{Earth}}\\) : \\[(3.156 \\times 10^7)^2 \\approx 9.96 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ s}^2\\] Again, the calculated value is very close to the square of the Earth's orbital period, validating Kepler's Third Law. 4. Computational Model We can create a simplified computational model using Python to simulate circular orbits and observe the relationship between orbital period and radius. Below is an example Python script: This plot demonstrates the linear relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, visually confirming Kepler's Third Law. The slope of the linear fit is proportional to \\(1/(GM)\\) . The Python code calculates and plots the relationship between the radius and the period, and also plots the square of the period against the cube of the radius to demonstrate the linear relationship predicted by Kepler's Third Law. The linear fit to the \\(T^2\\) vs \\(r^3\\) plot will have a slope equal to \\(\\frac{4\\pi^2}{GM}\\) . import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Constants G = 6.674 * 10 -11 # Gravitational constant (N\u00b7m\u00b2/kg\u00b2) M = 1.989 * 10 30 # Mass of the Sun (kg) Function to calculate orbital period def orbital_period(r): return np.sqrt((4 * np.pi 2 * r 3) / (G * M)) Radii for the curve radii = np.linspace(1e10, 5e12, 100) # in meters T_squared = (orbital_period(radii)) 2 r_cubed = radii 3 Planetary data (semi-major axis in meters, orbital period in seconds) planets = { \"Mercury\": (5.79e10, 7.6e6), \"Venus\": (1.082e11, 1.94e7), \"Earth\": (1.496e11, 3.156e7), \"Mars\": (2.279e11, 5.93e7), \"Jupiter\": (7.785e11, 3.74e8) } Prepare planet data for plotting planet_r_cubed = [r 3 for r, T in planets.values()] planet_T_squared = [T 2 for r, T in planets.values()] Plot T^2 vs r^3 on a log-log scale plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) plt.plot(r_cubed, T_squared, label=\"T\u00b2 vs r\u00b3 (Kepler's Law)\", color='blue') plt.scatter(planet_r_cubed, planet_T_squared, color='red', s=50, label=\"Planets\", zorder=5) Add planet labels for name, (r, T) in planets.items(): plt.text(r 3, T 2, name, fontsize=9, ha='right') plt.xscale('log') plt.yscale('log') plt.xlabel(\"r\u00b3 (m\u00b3)\") plt.ylabel(\"T\u00b2 (s\u00b2)\") plt.title(\"Kepler's Third Law: T\u00b2 vs r\u00b3\") plt.grid(True, which='both', ls='--') plt.legend() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() 5. Extension to Elliptical Orbits For elliptical orbits, Kepler's Third Law still holds, but the radius \\(r\\) is replaced by the semi-major axis \\(a\\) of the ellipse. The semi-major axis is half of the longest diameter of the ellipse and is the average of the perihelion (closest approach) and aphelion (farthest distance) distances. The law can be written as: \\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 a^3}{GM}\\] where \\(a\\) is the length of the semi-major axis. This extension is crucial for understanding the orbits of planets, comets, and many other celestial bodies that do not follow perfectly circular paths. The derivation for elliptical orbits involves more advanced mathematics and takes into account the varying speed of the orbiting object as it moves along its elliptical path, as described by Kepler's Second Law (the law of equal areas).","title":"Orbital Period and Orbital Radius"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#orbital-period-and-orbital-radius","text":"","title":"Orbital Period and Orbital Radius"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#motivation","text":"The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law , is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics.

It accounts for the combined gravitational influence of Earth and the Sun. Mathematical Derivations First Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_1\\) ) For a stable circular orbit, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force: \\[\\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \\frac{mv_1^2}{r}\\] Where: \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N m}^2/\\text{kg}^2\\) ) \\(M\\) is the mass of the celestial body \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting object \\(r\\) is the radius of the orbit (approximated as the radius of the celestial body for orbits close to the surface) Solving for \\(v_1\\) : \\[v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{r}}\\] Second Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_2\\) ) The kinetic energy of the object must equal the gravitational potential energy: \\[\\frac{1}{2}mv_2^2 = \\frac{GMm}{r}\\] Solving for \\(v_2\\) : \\[v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\] Thus, \\(v_2 = \\sqrt{2}v_1\\) . Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ) To calculate the third cosmic velocity, we consider the object's initial velocity (Earth's orbital velocity) and the additional velocity needed to escape the Sun's gravitational pull. Earth's Orbital Velocity ( \\(v_{\\text{Earth}}\\) ): This is the first cosmic velocity with respect to the Sun at Earth's orbital radius. Solar Escape Velocity at Earth's Orbit ( \\(v_{\\text{Solar Escape}}\\) ): This is the second cosmic velocity with respect to the Sun at Earth's orbital radius. Third Cosmic Velocity ( \\(v_3\\) ): To calculate the third cosmic velocity (escape from the Solar System starting at Earth's surface), we account for: Escaping Earth's gravity - requiring Earth's second cosmic velocity \\(v_2\\) . Reaching solar escape velocity at Earth's orbital radius ( \\(v_{\\text{Solar Escape}}\\) ). Compensating for the orbital velocity of Earth around the Sun ( \\(v_{\\text{Earth Orbital}}\\) ), which assists or hinders depending on direction. Simplified Calculation: \\[v_3 = \\sqrt{v_{\\text{SolarEscape}}^2 + (v_2 - v_{\\text{EarthOrbital}})^2}\\] This expression assumes the spacecraft launches in the same direction as Earth's orbital motion. The \\((v_2 - v_{\\text{EarthOrbital}})\\) term reflects the adjustment needed after escaping Earth to reach the solar escape velocity.

When a payload is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its subsequent trajectory is governed by its initial conditions (position and velocity at the time of release) and the gravitational force exerted by Earth. This problem explores the different types of trajectories possible and provides a computational tool to simulate and visualize these paths. Theoretical Background The motion of the payload is primarily governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation , which states that every particle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, the force \\(F\\) exerted by Earth (mass \\(M\\) ) on the payload (mass \\(m\\) ) is given by: \\[F = -G \\frac{Mm}{r^2} \\hat{r}\\] where: * \\(G\\) is the universal gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}^2/\\text{kg}^2\\) ), * \\(M\\) is the mass of Earth ( \\(5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\text{ kg}\\) ), * \\(m\\) is the mass of the payload, * \\(r\\) is the distance between the center of Earth and the payload, * \\(\\hat{r}\\) is the unit vector pointing from the center of Earth to the payload. From Newton's second law of motion ( \\(F = ma\\) ), the acceleration \\(a\\) of the payload is: \\[a = \\frac{F}{m} = -G \\frac{M}{r^2} \\hat{r}\\] This acceleration is always directed towards the center of Earth. Types of Trajectories The type of trajectory the payload will follow depends on its total mechanical energy , which is the sum of its kinetic energy ( \\(K\\) ) and potential energy ( \\(U\\) ). The gravitational potential energy of the payload at a distance \\(r\\) from the center of Earth is: \\[U = -G \\frac{Mm}{r}\\] The kinetic energy of the payload with velocity \\(v\\) is: \\[K = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\] The total energy \\(E\\) is: \\[E = K + U = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - G \\frac{Mm}{r}\\] The shape of the trajectory is determined by the sign of the total energy: Elliptical Trajectory ( \\(E < 0\\) ) : If the total energy is negative, the payload is bound to Earth and will follow an elliptical orbit. A circle is a special case of an ellipse where the eccentricity is zero. This is typical for payloads that are intended to orbit Earth. Parabolic Trajectory ( \\(E = 0\\) ) : If the total energy is exactly zero, the payload will follow a parabolic trajectory. This is the minimum energy required for the payload to escape Earth's gravitational pull and never return. The velocity at which this occurs at a given distance \\(r\\) is the escape velocity : \\( \\(v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\) \\) Hyperbolic Trajectory ( \\(E > 0\\) ) : If the total energy is positive, the payload has more than enough energy to escape Earth's gravity and will follow a hyperbolic trajectory. Numerical Simulation To simulate the motion of the payload, we can use numerical methods to solve the equations of motion. We will use a simple Euler method for this demonstration, but more accurate methods like the Runge-Kutta method can be used for higher precision. Let \\(\\mathbf{r} = (x, y)\\) be the position vector of the payload and \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)\\) be its velocity vector in a 2D plane (we can extend this to 3D if needed). The acceleration vector \\(\\mathbf{a} = (a_x, a_y)\\) is given by: \\[a_x = -GM \\frac{x}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}$$ $$a_y = -GM \\frac{y}{(x^2 + y^2)^{3/2}}\\] The Euler method updates the position and velocity at each time step \\(\\Delta t\\) as follows: \\[\\mathbf{v}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{v}_i + \\mathbf{a}_i \\Delta t$$ $$\\mathbf{r}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{r}_i + \\mathbf{v}_i \\Delta t\\] The code has been extended to simulate the trajectories of a payload released from an altitude of 800 km above Earth's surface. We are now investigating multiple launch velocities ranging from 5 km/s to 13 km/s (with 0.5 km/s increments). Each trajectory is computed using the Euler method to numerically solve the equations of motion under Earth's gravitational force. Simulation and Plotting We simulate the trajectories for various initial velocities, starting each payload at a position 800 km above Earth, placed on the right side of Earth (positive x-axis). The velocities tested include: 5.0 km/s 5.5 km/s 6.0 km/s ... 13.0 km/s Each velocity represents a different scenario for the payload's trajectory, which could be elliptical (orbit), escape, or reentry based on the initial conditions. The Earth is drawn to scale in the plot as a blue circle, and the trajectories are displayed accordingly. Re-entry Trajectories : For velocities below the orbital velocity of Earth at this altitude. Elliptical Trajectories : For velocities near the orbital velocity of Earth at this altitude. Escape Trajectories : For velocities greater than the escape velocity of Earth at the given altitude. The simulation also now visually shows the Earth in the plot for context. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Constants G = 6.674e-11 # Gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2) M_earth = 5.972e24 # Earth mass (kg) R_earth = 6371e3 # Earth radius (m) Initial conditions altitude = 800e3 initial_distance = R_earth + altitude initial_position = [initial_distance, 0] # on the right side Velocity range (in m/s) velocities_kms = np.arange(5.0, 13.5, 0.5) velocities = velocities_kms * 1e3 Time parameters dt = 1 # time step (s) time_steps = 20000 Containers for categorized results crashes = [] orbits = [] escapes = [] def simulate_trajectory(position, velocity, steps, dt): pos = np.array(position, dtype=float) vel = np.array(velocity, dtype=float) traj = [pos.copy()] for _ in range(steps): r = np.linalg.norm(pos) if r <= R_earth: return np.array(traj), \"crash\" if r > 10 * initial_distance: return np.array(traj), \"escape\" acc = -G * M_earth * pos / r**3 vel += acc * dt pos += vel * dt traj.append(pos.copy()) return np.array(traj), \"orbit\" Simulate all velocities for v in velocities: v0 = [0, v] traj, kind = simulate_trajectory(initial_position, v0, time_steps, dt) if kind == \"crash\": crashes.append((v, traj)) elif kind == \"orbit\": orbits.append((v, traj)) elif kind == \"escape\": escapes.append((v, traj)) --- Plot Crash Cases (Zoomed In) --- plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) for v, traj in crashes: plt.plot(traj[:, 0], traj[:, 1], label=f\"{v/1000:.1f} km/s\") plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), R_earth, color='blue', alpha=0.3)) plt.scatter(0, 0, color='blue') plt.title(\"Trajectories that Crash into Earth\") plt.xlabel(\"X (m)\") plt.ylabel(\"Y (m)\") plt.axis('equal') plt.xlim(-1e7, 1.5e7) plt.ylim(-1e7, 1.5e7) plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() --- Plot Orbital Cases (Zoomed Out) --- plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) for v, traj in orbits: plt.plot(traj[:, 0], traj[:, 1], label=f\"{v/1000:.1f} km/s\") plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), R_earth, color='blue', alpha=0.3)) plt.scatter(0, 0, color='blue') plt.title(\"Orbital Trajectories\") plt.xlabel(\"X (m)\") plt.ylabel(\"Y (m)\") plt.axis('equal') plt.xlim(-5e7, 5e7) plt.ylim(-5e7, 5e7) plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() --- Plot Escape Cases (Zoomed Out More) --- plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8)) for v, traj in escapes: plt.plot(traj[:, 0], traj[:, 1], label=f\"{v/1000:.1f} km/s\") plt.gca().add_patch(plt.Circle((0, 0), R_earth, color='blue', alpha=0.3)) plt.scatter(0, 0, color='blue') plt.title(\"Trajectories that Escape Earth\") plt.xlabel(\"X (m)\") plt.ylabel(\"Y (m)\") plt.axis('equal') plt.xlim(-8e7, 1e8) plt.ylim(-8e7, 1e8) plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() Analysis and Discussion The simulation demonstrates different types of trajectories based on the initial velocity of the payload. Reentry: A reentry trajectory is one where the payload is directed back towards Earth's atmosphere. This occurs when the payload's velocity is lower than the orbital velocity at its altitude, causing it to lose altitude over time due to gravity. The \"Crash into Earth\" case illustrates this, where the payload's elliptical orbit intersects with Earth. Orbital Insertion: For a payload to be inserted into a stable orbit around Earth, its initial velocity at a certain altitude must be carefully chosen. The velocity should be high enough to counteract gravity and prevent the payload from falling back to Earth, but not so high that it escapes Earth's gravitational pull. The simulation with \"Orbital trajectories\" shows an elliptical trajectory, which, with fine-tuning of the initial velocity, could become a circular orbit. Orbital insertion typically involves achieving a specific velocity vector at a desired altitude. Escape: An escape trajectory is achieved when the payload's initial velocity is equal to or greater than the escape velocity at its initial position. In this case, the payload will have enough kinetic energy to overcome Earth's gravitational potential energy and move away from Earth indefinitely (following a parabolic or hyperbolic path). The \"Escape Earth\" simulation shows the payload moving away from Earth. Further Considerations and Improvements More Accurate Numerical Methods: The Euler method is simple but can be inaccurate for long simulations or large time steps. Using methods like the Runge-Kutta 4th order method would provide more accurate results. 3D Simulation: For more realistic scenarios, the simulation should be extended to three dimensions. Atmospheric Drag: In the lower altitudes, atmospheric drag plays a significant role in the trajectory of a payload, causing it to slow down and eventually burn up or land. This effect is not included in the current simulation. Perturbations: The gravitational forces of other celestial bodies (like the Moon and the Sun) can also affect the payload's trajectory over long periods. These perturbations are not considered here. Visualization: More sophisticated visualization tools can be used to create animations of the payload's motion.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#trajectories-of-a-freely-released-payload-near-earth","text":"","title":"Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#introduction","text":"Understanding the motion of objects under the influence of Earth's gravity is fundamental to space exploration.

A circle is a special case of an ellipse where the eccentricity is zero. This is typical for payloads that are intended to orbit Earth. Parabolic Trajectory ( \\(E = 0\\) ) : If the total energy is exactly zero, the payload will follow a parabolic trajectory. This is the minimum energy required for the payload to escape Earth's gravitational pull and never return. The velocity at which this occurs at a given distance \\(r\\) is the escape velocity : \\( \\(v_{\\text{esc}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{r}}\\) \\) Hyperbolic Trajectory ( \\(E > 0\\) ) : If the total energy is positive, the payload has more than enough energy to escape Earth's gravity and will follow a hyperbolic trajectory.","title":"Types of Trajectories"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#numerical-simulation","text":"To simulate the motion of the payload, we can use numerical methods to solve the equations of motion.

Reentry: A reentry trajectory is one where the payload is directed back towards Earth's atmosphere. This occurs when the payload's velocity is lower than the orbital velocity at its altitude, causing it to lose altitude over time due to gravity. The \"Crash into Earth\" case illustrates this, where the payload's elliptical orbit intersects with Earth. Orbital Insertion: For a payload to be inserted into a stable orbit around Earth, its initial velocity at a certain altitude must be carefully chosen. The velocity should be high enough to counteract gravity and prevent the payload from falling back to Earth, but not so high that it escapes Earth's gravitational pull. The simulation with \"Orbital trajectories\" shows an elliptical trajectory, which, with fine-tuning of the initial velocity, could become a circular orbit. Orbital insertion typically involves achieving a specific velocity vector at a desired altitude. Escape: An escape trajectory is achieved when the payload's initial velocity is equal to or greater than the escape velocity at its initial position. In this case, the payload will have enough kinetic energy to overcome Earth's gravitational potential energy and move away from Earth indefinitely (following a parabolic or hyperbolic path). The \"Escape Earth\" simulation shows the payload moving away from Earth.","title":"Analysis and Discussion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#further-considerations-and-improvements","text":"More Accurate Numerical Methods: The Euler method is simple but can be inaccurate for long simulations or large time steps.

Atmospheric Drag: In the lower altitudes, atmospheric drag plays a significant role in the trajectory of a payload, causing it to slow down and eventually burn up or land. This effect is not included in the current simulation. Perturbations: The gravitational forces of other celestial bodies (like the Moon and the Sun) can also affect the payload's trajectory over long periods. These perturbations are not considered here.
